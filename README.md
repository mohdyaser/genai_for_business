## Prompting Principles
- **Principle 1: Write clear and specific instructions**
- **Principle 2: Give the model time to “think”**

### Tactics

#### Tactic 1: Use delimiters to clearly indicate distinct parts of the input
- Delimiters can be anything like: ```, """, < >, `<tag> </tag>`, `:`


```python
text = f"""
You should express what you want a model to do by \ 
providing instructions that are as clear and \ 
specific as you can possibly make them. \ 
This will guide the model towards the desired output, \ 
and reduce the chances of receiving irrelevant \ 
or incorrect responses. Don't confuse writing a \ 
clear prompt with writing a short prompt. \ 
In many cases, longer prompts provide more clarity \ 
and context for the model, which can lead to \ 
more detailed and relevant outputs.
"""
prompt = f"""
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \ 
into a single sentence.
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 2: Ask for a structured output
- JSON, HTML


```python
prompt = f"""
Generate a list of three made-up book titles along \ 
with their authors and genres. 
Provide them in JSON format with the following keys: 
book_id, title, author, genre.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 3: Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied


```python
text_1 = f"""
Making a cup of tea is easy! First, you need to get some \ 
water boiling. While that's happening, \ 
grab a cup and put a tea bag in it. Once the water is \ 
hot enough, just pour it over the tea bag. \ 
Let it sit for a bit so the tea can steep. After a \ 
few minutes, take out the tea bag. If you \ 
like, you can add some sugar or milk to taste. \ 
And that's it! You've got yourself a delicious \ 
cup of tea to enjoy.
"""
prompt = f"""
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes. 
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \ 
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1 - ...
Step 2 - …
…
Step N - …

If the text does not contain a sequence of instructions, \ 
then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_1}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 1:")
print(response)
```


```python
text_2 = f"""
The sun is shining brightly today, and the birds are \
singing. It's a beautiful day to go for a \ 
walk in the park. The flowers are blooming, and the \ 
trees are swaying gently in the breeze. People \ 
are out and about, enjoying the lovely weather. \ 
Some are having picnics, while others are playing \ 
games or simply relaxing on the grass. It's a \ 
perfect day to spend time outdoors and appreciate the \ 
beauty of nature.

re-write those instructions in the following format:

then simply write \"No steps provided.\"

\"\"\"{text_2}\"\"\"
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print("Completion for Text 2:")
print(response)
```

#### Tactic 4: "Few-shot" prompting


```python
prompt = f"""
Your task is to answer in a consistent style.

<child>: Teach me about patience.

<grandparent>: The river that carves the deepest \ 
valley flows from a modest spring; the \ 
grandest symphony originates from a single note; \ 
the most intricate tapestry begins with a solitary thread.

<child>: Teach me about resilience.
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```

### Principle 2: Give the model time to “think” 

#### Tactic 1: Specify the steps required to complete a task


```python
text = f"""
In a charming village, siblings Jack and Jill set out on \ 
a quest to fetch water from a hilltop \ 
well. As they climbed, singing joyfully, misfortune \ 
struck—Jack tripped on a stone and tumbled \ 
down the hill, with Jill following suit. \ 
Though slightly battered, the pair returned home to \ 
comforting embraces. Despite the mishap, \ 
their adventurous spirits remained undimmed, and they \ 
continued exploring with delight.

# example 1
prompt_1 = f"""
Perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by triple \
backticks with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the following \
keys: french_summary, num_names.

Separate your answers with line breaks.

Text:
```{text}```
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_1)
print("Completion for prompt 1:")
print(response)
```

#### Ask for output in a specified format


```python
prompt_2 = f"""
Your task is to perform the following actions: 
1 - Summarize the following text delimited by 
  <> with 1 sentence.
2 - Translate the summary into French.
3 - List each name in the French summary.
4 - Output a json object that contains the 
  following keys: french_summary, num_names.

Use the following format:
Text: <text to summarize>
Summary: <summary>
Translation: <summary translation>
Names: <list of names in summary>
Output JSON: <json with summary and num_names>

Text: <{text}>
"""
response = get_completion(prompt_2)
print("\nCompletion for prompt 2:")
print(response)
```


## Model Limitations: Hallucinations
- Boie is a real company, the product name is not real.


```python
prompt = f"""
Tell me about AeroGlide UltraSlim Smart Toothbrush by Boie
"""
response = get_completion(prompt)
print(response)
```
